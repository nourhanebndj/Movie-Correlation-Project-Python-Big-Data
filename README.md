# Movie Correlation Analysis

This project aims to analyze the correlation between various features of movies, such as budget, gross earnings, ratings, and other factors. The goal is to understand how these elements are related to each other and to identify any significant relationships that may exist.

The analysis is conducted using Python and data visualization libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The dataset used includes information on various movies, including the name, genre, director, budget, gross earnings, and other relevant attributes.

The results of this analysis are presented in the form of correlation matrices and heatmaps, which allow for the visualization of the relationships between different variables in the dataset.

This project can be useful for data analysts, film researchers, or anyone interested in the film industry who wants to understand what factors contribute to a movie's success.
